# Simple-ML-Examples

The following Repository provides an overview of the foundations required to grasp the basic concepts used in Machine Learning.

Each notebook will describe a given concept, and then provide some math examples some code examples to make it clear on how to develop a programatic approach to implementing the technique.

### Mathematical Techniques:
- Differentiation
- Integration (to-do)
