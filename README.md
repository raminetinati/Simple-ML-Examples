# Simple-ML-Examples

The following Repository provides an overview of the foundations required to grasp the basic concepts used in Machine Learning.

Each notebook will describe a given concept, and then provide some math examples some code examples to make it clear on how to develop a programatic approach to implementing the technique.

### Mathematical Techniques:
- Differentiation
- Integration (to-do)
- Vector Math (to-do)

### Machine Learning Techniques:
- Line of Equation
- Gradient Descent
- Cross-Entropy
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
